# BIBSnet tier1 wrapper

This wrapper creates a run file for each subject in a BIDS directory and runs BIBSnet. 

Specify the necessary paths in the make_run_files.sh and the resources needed in resources_bibsnet.sh

This is still being tested to see if it still works with the new BIBSnet. (as of 28 Nov 23)
