# BIBSnet s3 with ses

This wrapper pulls down one subject at a time from an s3 bucket, runs BIBsnet, then pushes the processed output back to the bucket.

Specify the necessary paths in the make_run_files.sh and the resources needed in resources_bibsnet.sh

This is still being tested to see if it still works with the new BIBSnet. (as of 28 Nov 23)
